## Frill Backstory
----------------------

Frills are semi-unique luxury items coveted by collectors. A Frill contains one or more colorful widgets and two specialized casings connected by a shared hinge. Widgets are notoriously fragile and susceptible to color fade, cracking, and warping. A Frill’s casings cover it's widgets and provide them with a minimal amount of protection - however, the casings themselves are made of a malleable material prone to denting, and in some instances, is even known to fall off completely. To complicate matters, the casings shared hinge is easily bent, and in some instances, has been known to break off completely.

Frill are made available to collectors in generations that are defined by their widget count. Frill’s from the earliest generations that still remain in a defect-free condition are highly valued by collectors. The existing Frill generations, listed from oldest to current, are as follows:

* **Diamond** - contains six widgets
* **Emerald** - contains five widgets 
* **Sapphire** - contains three to four widgets
* **Ruby** - contains two widgets
* **Opal** - contains one widgets
